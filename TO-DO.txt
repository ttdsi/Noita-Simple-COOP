[[[[[[[[[[[[[[PLAYER 3 NOT SPAWNING]]]]]]]]]]]]]]







--inventory mouse click p2
--PLACE P2's Mouse at aim vector to display where to throw flask
--On Polymorph , player might teleport to temple and trigger respawn duplicating the character
-- On respawn the ui all fucked up
--camera buttons dont work


----[PREVIOUS TODO BEFORE REMAKE]
- UI Improvements [2] ------ crazy
- Perk Share works on unstackable perks (ex. Projectile Repulsion Field) [4]

----[FEATURES TBD]
--take money from player 1 when p2 spawns
- Transfer Money without picking up gold
--Get P2 to react to all random wand logic and onplayer spawn calls
- Different Robes




---[Legendary]
--create a COOP Gamemode on the main menu


-------[Notes]
--Seems like theres a script from noita that forces gui to be in default X,Y Only when player1 respawns. Hunt it down!!

---[Fudamental]
3 players the first 2 rely on p3 -- bad
fix by removing deligations the p3 gives to 1 and 2
MOD IS NOT COMPATA WITH ALL THAT DATA FILE USAGE
